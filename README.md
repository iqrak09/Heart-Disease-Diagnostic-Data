Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis as part of my internship with Unified Mentor, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into heart disease data.

In this project, I used Python to analyze Heart Disease data and created visualizations to better understand trends and patterns. 

I had a great time working on this project and gained as well as learned a lot in the process. I hope it inspires you to swoop into data analysis and explore the insights that can be gained from it.
